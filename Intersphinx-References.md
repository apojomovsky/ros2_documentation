**As of ROS 2 Bouncy the recommended build tool is `colcon` described in the [colcon tutorial](Colcon-Tutorial.md).**

# Overview

This will provide you with a quick summary of how to get up and running using an ament workspace.
It will be a practical tutorial and is not designed to replace the core documentation.

## Background

Ament is an iteration on the catkin meta-build tool.
For more information on the design of ament see [this document](http://design.ros2.org/articles/ament.html).

The source can be found in the [ament GitHub organization](https://github.com/ament).

## Reference to External Sphinx Projects

It's now possible to reference external sphinx projects. A couple of examples are shown below:
First reference to an external project rosdistro.html#module-rosdistro.rosdistro
Second reference to another external project vcstools.html#vcstools.svn.canonical_svn_url_split
